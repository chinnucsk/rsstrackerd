ESPN's Paul Biancardi was tasked with finding sleepers outside of ESPN's top 25 players who would outperform the rankings, and <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/9231151/top-five-sleepers-final-2013-espn-100-player-rankings\">struck upon Derrick Walton</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>1. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/102632/derrick-walton\">Derrick Walton</a>, PG, Michigan        <br />Final ESPN 100 rank: No. 30</b>      <br />? Walton, who will replace Burke and take the mantle as Michigan's point guard, has some similar traits to Burke as he is small, tough and competitive. Although we have Walton ranked No. 30, which is relatively high, he still has to fight for everything he earns -- which is what makes him special. Walton will lead the Wolverines and will have a wealth of talent around him with a mixture of scorers, size and a strong incoming freshman class coming in with him. Look for him to push the pace with a high-speed dribble and find teammates off penetration with his peripheral vision. Walton is battle tested and has played on the travel team circuit against some of the nation's best point guards and had his way. Don't be surprised to see him get more assists than points in any given game, yet he can also make big shots when his team needs them most. He is a clutch performer with the perfect mindset for his position. The opportunity is there for Walton; look for him to capitalize on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then Reggie Rankin was tasked with doing so with recruiting classes outside the top ten and picked three of the next four<a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/9234719/top-five-sleeper-recruiting-classes-2013-basketball-class-rankings\">, one of which happens to be M</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>2. <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/classrankings/rank?rank=12&amp;class=2013&amp;date=20130501\">Michigan</a> (No. 12 class) </b>      <br />The Wolverines have added three ESPN 100 prospects who are not only talented and will excel in John Beilein's system, but also who address some of the team's needs after losing <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/67086/trey-burke\">Trey Burke</a> and Tim Hardaway Jr. to the NBA. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/102632/derrick-walton\">Derrick Walton</a> is an excellent point guard who pushes the pace and can deliver the rock at high speeds or execute when the defense is set. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/103531/zak-irvin\">Zak Irvin</a> is a quick fix on the wing because of his size, athleticism and ability to flat-out get buckets with his aggressive approach on the offensive end of the floor. Power forward <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/140197/mark-donnal\">Mark Donnal</a> is skilled and can finish in the paint or stretch the defense with his range to about 18 feet. This class will excel in Beilein's system because all three have the IQ and skills to make high-level plays. Expect this Michigan class to be an NCAA tournament mainstay as long as it is together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are not bold forays onto ...
